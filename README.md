# Smart-Greenhouse-
An IoT based system. This project details the development of an automated, Smart Greenhouse System designed to monitor and regulate environmental conditions crucial for optimal plant growth. Using a NodeMCU (ESP8266/ESP32) microcontroller, the system provides real-time data and autonomous control over critical factors like temperature,moisture.
